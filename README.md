## Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Differentiation

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, primarily categorized into Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease. Despite similar symptoms, these subtypes differ in etiology and treatment strategies, highlighting the need for accurate differentiation.

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and proteomics have enabled the use of biological pathway databases (e.g., KEGG, MSigDB) for improved classification. While previous studies focused on Gene Ontology and specific pathways, our approach integrates multi-source network data, including complexes, kinases, metabolism, and regulatory networks. This integration enhances data richness, accuracy, and biological insights, while addressing the limitations of noise and specificity associated with single data sources.
